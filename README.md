## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Project Notes

I added a few pieces of extra functionality to the project.
- As each section comes into the viewport, the corresponding navbar link gets an active state and becomes highlighted.
- A button was added to scroll to the top of the page once section 1 is out of the viewport.
- Added a few extra sections to expand the dynamically generated navbar.
